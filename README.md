Linux USB-install on my fujitsu lifebook 

I was trying to run a USB-install with Fedora 36 on my fujitsu lifebook u7410 but it did not boot from usb.

```bash
set_second_stage() failed: invalid Parameter
Something has done seriously wrong: shim_init() failed Invalid Parameter
```


Avoid this problem by making a bootable USB with [ventoy USB tool](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html)
